# My Personal Project

## Project Description
*What will the application do? Who will use it?*

The project I am proposing to design is a music rating application. In this application, you can add songs to your playlist, rate each song on a scale out of five, and leave reviews on the songs. This application is for people who enjoy listening to music and want to keep track of the songs they listen to. Whether youâ€™re a casual listener or a seasoned music critic, anyone can use this program!

*Why is this project of interest to you?*

This project is of interest to me because I have always enjoyed music. I listen to music all the time; when I take walks, do homework, and sometimes I dedicate time just to listen to music. Because I love listening to music, having an application where I can record my opinions of songs will make it easier to keep track of the songs I listen to.
